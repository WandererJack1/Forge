**Forge is a full-stack web framework for building React applications using Rust as the backend with
a strong focus on usability and performance.**

The Forge Project
Why Forge? Because we are grinding complexity into modern simplicity.

If you have experience with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) you will feel home here.

Some of its features are:

-  Native Typescript
-  Next.js like Routing
-  CSS/SCSS modules
-  Server Side Rendering
-  Hot Module Reload

## Installation

Available on MacOS, Linux and Windows.

```sh
cargo install Forge
```

## Getting started

Create a new project with:

```sh
Forge new [PROJECT_NAME]
```

> You can optionally pass the --template (or -t) flag to directly start from a [template](https://github.com/TheJackMan33/Forge/tree/main/examples)

Now just install the dependencies with you favourite JS package manager (i.e. `npm install`) and start the development environment

```sh
Forge dev
```
